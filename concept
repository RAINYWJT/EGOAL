Strain and Characteristics:
Strain: MR-1(pBBR-glk-galP)
GO Concept: “Shewanella oneidensis MR-1” (GO:0051974)
Treatment:
Grown under a fumarate-respiring condition.
GO Concept: “fumarate respiration” (GO:0045333)
Treatment Protocol:
The cell suspension was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 1 minute to precipitate the cells.
Growth Protocol:
MR-1(pBBR-glk-galP) was grown in GMM (minimal medium) supplemented with fumarate (40 mM) as an electron acceptor.
Cells were harvested during the logarithmic growth phase (OD600 0.2–0.3).
Incubated for 3 hours in either the presence (fumarate-respiring condition) or absence (fermentative condition) of fumarate.
