ATP:polyphosphate phosphotransferase activity","modulation of host PP1 activity by virus
regulation by virus of host PP1 activity
OBSOLETE. The process in which a virus effects a change in host protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) activity, a serine/threonine phosphatase. Different viruses modulate host PP1 activity to remove phosphates from various cellular substrates and downregulate the host's antiviral response.

Catalysis of the transfer of a phosphorus-containing group from one compound (donor) to another (acceptor).","Catalysis of the transfer of two phosphate groups from a donor, such as ATP, to two different acceptors.
phosphotransferase activity, paired acceptors","An enzyme complex that catalyzes the removal of the phosphate group from phosphomyosin. Composed of a PP1 catalytic subunit (PP1c/PPP1CB) and a myosin phosphatase targeting subunit (MYPT1/PPP1R12A).

OBSOLETE. The process of introducing a phosphate group into UDP, uridine diphosphate, to produce UTP.","P-type transmembrane transporter activity
E1-E2 ATPase
Primary active transporter that auto-phosphorylates (hence P) at a key conserved aspartate residue, generating a conformational change that allows transport of the substrate. Hydrolysis of the phosphorylated Asp residue, catalyzed by the actuator (A) domain, results in another state with occluded substrates. Upon dissociation of Mg2+ and Pi, the enzyme reverts to the initial state, in which the counter-transported substrate is released into the cytosol.
P-type ATPase","phosphotransferase activity, nitrogenous group as acceptor
Catalysis of the transfer of a phosphorus-containing group from one compound (donor) to a nitrogenous group (acceptor)."

OBSOLETE. Plasmid-encoded bacteriocins which are produced by enteric bacteria. Exert a lethal effect on other bacteria including E. coli strains that lack the Col plasmid. Bind to a cell surface receptor and are transported into the periplasm via an energy-dependent process involving a TonB- or TolA-dependent hetero-oligomeric protein complex. Some colicins kill their target cell by inserting into the cytoplasmic membrane where they form voltage-sensitive (trans-negative) channels that depolarize and deenergize the cell, and thereby kill it.

fimbriae assembly
fimbriae biogenesis
fimbria biogenesis
fimbrium biogenesis
The assembly from its constituent parts of a pilus, a short filamentous structure of bacterial cell, flagella-like in structure and generally present in many copies. Pili are variously involved in transfer of nucleic acids, adherence to surfaces, and formation of pellicles. Is required for bacterial conjugation, or can play a role in adherence to surfaces (when it is called a fimbrium), and in the formation of pellicles.
