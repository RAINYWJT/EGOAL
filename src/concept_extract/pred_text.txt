Transformed the bacteria with PPK1 gene plasmid (PPK1 converts reversible poly p into Pi and generates ATP). Detected increased electron transfer activity and improved phosphorus removal efficiency in transformed bacteria.
Transformed the bacteria with PPX gene plasmid (PPX converts poly p into Pi without generating ATP). Detected increased electron transfer activity and improved phosphorus removal efficiency in transformed bacteria.
