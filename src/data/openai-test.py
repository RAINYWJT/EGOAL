            treatment: grown under a fumarate-respiring condition
            Treatment protocol 	The cell suspension was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 1 min to precipitate the cells.
            Growth protocol 	MR-1(pBBR-glk-galP) was grown in GMM supplemented with fumarate (40 mM) as an electron acceptor, and cells were harvested at the logarithmic growth phase (OD600 0.2â€“0.3). These cells were incubated for 3 h in the presence (the fumarate-respiring condition) or absence (the fermentative condition) of fumarate.'''},
