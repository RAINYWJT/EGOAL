The cell suspension was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 1 min to precipitate the cells.
MR-1(pBBR-glk-galP) was grown in GMM supplemented with fumarate (40 mM) as an electron acceptor, and cells were harvested at the logarithmic growth phase (OD600 0.2–0.3). These cells were incubated for 3 h in the presence (the fumarate-respiring condition) or absence (the fermentative condition) of fumarate.

An electrochemical flow cell (EFC) was filled with lactate minimal medium (LMM) containing gentamicin (Gm) and was purged with pure nitrogen gas (99.999%) for anaerobic operation. After inoculation with AFP-expressing MR-1 pregrown in LB medium supplemented with Gm, the electrodes were connected to a potentiostat (VMP3; Bio-Logic Science Instruments, Seyssinet-Pariset, France), and the potential of the working electrode (WE) was poised at +0.2 V (versus the standard hydrogen electrode). After inoculation, medium (electrolyte) was not supplied to the EFC for approximately 1 h, to allow MR-1 cells to attach to the WE. For operation under the electrolyte-flow conditions, LMM containing Gm was supplied to the EFC at a constant linear velocity of 5.5 mm min-1. The EFC was operated for 48 h (for the flow condition) or 78 h (for the non-flow condition) until the WE-associated cells reached the early stationary growth phase.

Our defined medium contained 30 mM PIPES buffer, salts (1.5 g/L NH4Cl, 0.1 g/L KCl, 1.75 g/L NaCl, 0.61 g/L MgCl2.6H20, 0.6 g/L NaH2PO4), Wolfe's vitamins, and Wolfe's minerals, at pH 7. For the stress experiments, the carbon source was 20 mM D,L-lactate. For growth at pH 6, we used 30 mM MES buffer instead of PIPES. All samples were grown at 30C with shaking at 200 rpm. For three conditions, we also measured gene expression during batch growth.

We collected expression data for 15 conditions: aerobic growth in Luria-Bertani broth; aerobic growth in defined minimal media with 8 different carbon sources (20 mM D,L-lactate, 20 mM pyruvate, 10 mM acetate, 20 mM N-acetylglucosamine (NAG), 5 mg/mL mixed amino acids (CAS), 1 mg/mL gelatin, 0.5% Tween-20, or 7.5 mM inosine); aerobic growth in defined lactate medium with four different stresses (70 micromolar copper(II) chloride; 1 mM sodium nitrite; 1.5 micromolar nalidixic acid, an inhibitor of DNA gyrase; or acid stress at pH 6); and anaerobic growth in a defined medium with 20 mM D,L-lactate or 20 mM NAG as the carbon source and 30 mM fumarate as the electron acceptor. Our defined medium contained 30 mM PIPES buffer, salts (1.5 g/L NH4Cl, 0.1 g/L KCl, 1.75 g/L NaCl, 0.61 g/L MgCl2.6H20, 0.6 g/L NaH2PO4), Wolfe's vitamins, and Wolfe's minerals, at pH 7. For the stress experiments, the carbon source was 20 mM D,L-lactate. For growth at pH 6, we used 30 mM MES buffer instead of PIPES. All samples were grown at 30C with shaking at 200 rpm. For three conditions, we also measured gene expression during batch growth. We collected cells at varying times after inoculation of batch aerobic growth at OD600 of 0.1 on minimal lactate medium, minimal NAG medium, or LB.
