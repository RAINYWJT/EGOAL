fumarate transmembrane transporter activity
dicarboxylate (succinate/fumarate/malate) antiporter activity","A membrane-bound flavoenzyme complex consisting of four subunits, A, B, C, and D. A and B comprise the membrane-extrinsic catalytic domain and C (InterPro:IPR003510; InterPro:IPR004224) and D (InterPro:IPR003418) link the catalytic centers to the electron-transport chain. This family consists of the 13 kDa hydrophobic subunit D. This component may be required to anchor the catalytic components of the fumarate reductase complex to the cytoplasmic membrane. Fumarate reductase couples the reduction of fumarate to succinate to the oxidation of quinol to quinone, in a reaction opposite to that catalyzed by the related complex II of the respiratory chain (succinate dehydrogenase-(ubiquinone)).

An electrochemical flow cell (EFC) was filled with lactate minimal medium (LMM) containing gentamicin (Gm) and was purged with pure nitrogen gas (99.999%) for anaerobic operation. After inoculation with AFP-expressing MR-1 pregrown in LB medium supplemented with Gm, the electrodes were connected to a potentiostat (VMP3; Bio-Logic Science Instruments, Seyssinet-Pariset, France), and the potential of the working electrode (WE) was poised at +0.2 V (versus the standard hydrogen electrode). After inoculation, medium (electrolyte) was not supplied to the EFC for approximately 1 h, to allow MR-1 cells to attach to the WE.

This ATP-dependent cycle is essential for nitrogen-limited growth and for steady-state growth with some sources of nitrogen.","The anaerobic chemical reactions and pathways resulting in the breakdown of glutamate, via the intermediate 2-hydroxyglutarate, yielding energy in the form of ATP.

Cells associated with the WE were suspended in LMM with vigorous pipetting. After vortex-mixing, the cell suspension was centrifuged at 15,000 g for 5 min to precipitate the cells.
An electrochemical flow cell (EFC) was filled with lactate minimal medium (LMM) containing gentamicin (Gm) and was purged with pure nitrogen gas (99.999%) for anaerobic operation. After inoculation with AFP-expressing MR-1 pregrown in LB medium supplemented with Gm, the electrodes were connected to a potentiostat (VMP3; Bio-Logic Science Instruments, Seyssinet-Pariset, France), and the potential of the working electrode (WE) was poised at +0.2 V (versus the standard hydrogen electrode). After inoculation, medium (electrolyte) was not supplied to the EFC for approximately 1 h, to allow MR-1 cells to attach to the WE. For operation under the electrolyte-flow conditions, LMM containing Gm was supplied to the EFC at a constant linear velocity of 5.5 mm min-1. The EFC was operated for 48 h (for the flow condition) or 78 h (for the non-flow condition) until the WE-associated cells reached the early stationary growth phase.

MMR complex","SHRED pathway
stress-induced homeostatically regulated protein degradation pathway
A stress-inducible protein catabolic pathway that promotes protein quality control by accelerating the degradation of misfolded ER membrane and cytosolic proteins, as well as native proteins. The pathway starts with the activation, by stress, of the Nma111p/Ynm3p serine protease, which cleaves the stress-induced hydrophilin Roq1p, resulting in the generation of a Roq1p cleavage product that selectively interacts with Ubr1p, an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Interaction with the Ubr1p type-1 substrate binding site reprograms the substrate specificity of this ubiquitin ligase resulting in the selective proteasome-mediated degradation of misfolded and native proteins. The pathway ends with degradation of the protein by the cytoplasmic proteasome. Currently, NMA111, ROQ1, UBR1, RAD6, and CDC48 are considered to be involved in this quality control pathway.","Mre11 complex assembly

Exert a lethal effect on other bacteria including E. coli strains that lack the Col plasmid. Bind to a cell surface receptor and are transported into the periplasm via an energy-dependent process involving a TonB- or TolA-dependent hetero-oligomeric protein complex. Some colicins kill their target cell by inserting into the cytoplasmic membrane where they form voltage-sensitive (trans-negative) channels that depolarize and deenergize the cell, and thereby kill it.

formaldehyde assimilation via RuMP cycle","Any process involved in the maturation of a precursor Small SubUnit (SSU) ribosomal RNA (rRNA) molecule into a mature SSU-rRNA molecule from the pre-rRNA molecule originally produced as a tetracistronic rRNA transcript that contains the Small Subunit (SSU) rRNA, 5.8 S rRNA, 2S rRNA, and Large Subunit (LSU) in that order from 5' to 3' along the primary transcript.

The medium contained sodium lactate (12.5 mM), sodium acetate (6.25 mM) sodium propionate (5 mM) as electron donors. Standard anaerobic techniques were used throughout the study (Balch et al.

To remove oxygen, the media were boiled for 10 minutes and flushed with a mixture of 80% N2/20% CO2 for 30 min. After that, the pH was adjusted to 7.2. The optical density during anaerobic growth on ferric citrate was measured at a wavelength of 655 nm to avoid an influence by ferric iron.  All experiments were carried out in at least three independent replicates. Error bars represent the standard deviation.

A 20% dissolved oxygen tension (DOT) was maintained until the culture reached stationary phase. The bioreactor was then switched to continuous mode with a dilution rate of 0.05 h−1 while DOT was still maintained at 20%. After 48 hours in continuous mode, a reference sample of cells was harvested for RNA isolation (control). The automatic DOT control was then turned off and DOT was reduced from 20% to 0% (within 3-5 minutes). Once the DOT was no longer measurable by a polarographic O2 electrode, the first sample was taken (t=0). However, note that this was not an anaerobic state; air was still being provided to the reactor, but with DOT just below detection of the polarographic O2 electrode. Samples were subsequently taken at 15 min intervals for an hour.

A 20% dissolved oxygen tension (DOT) was maintained until the culture reached stationary phase. The bioreactor was then switched to continuous mode with a dilution rate of 0.05 h−1 while DOT was still maintained at 20%. After 48 hours in continuous mode, a reference sample of cells was harvested for RNA isolation (control). The automatic DOT control was then turned off and DOT was reduced from 20% to 0% (within 3-5 minutes). Once the DOT was no longer measurable by a polarographic O2 electrode, the first sample was taken (t=0).

After 48 hours in continuous mode, a reference sample of cells was harvested for RNA isolation (control). The automatic DOT control was then turned off and DOT was reduced from 20% to 0% (within 3-5 minutes). Once the DOT was no longer measurable by a polarographic O2 electrode, the first sample was taken (t=0). However, note that this was not an anaerobic state; air was still being provided to the reactor, but with DOT just below detection of the polarographic O2 electrode. Samples were subsequently taken at 15 min intervals for an hour.
Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 were grown in continuous flow reactors. Throughout the experiment, agitation was maintained at 200 rpm and culture maintained at pH 7.0 at 30 °C.

A 20% dissolved oxygen tension (DOT) was maintained until the culture reached stationary phase. The bioreactor was then switched to continuous mode with a dilution rate of 0.05 h−1 while DOT was still maintained at 20%. After 48 hours in continuous mode, a reference sample of cells was harvested for RNA isolation (control). The automatic DOT control was then turned off and DOT was reduced from 20% to 0% (within 3-5 minutes).

microgametophyte development
The process whose specific outcome is the progression of the pollen grain over time, from its formation to the mature structure. The process begins with the meiosis of the microsporocyte to form four haploid microspores. The nucleus of each microspore then divides by mitosis to form a two-celled organism, the pollen grain, that contains a tube cell as well as a smaller generative cell. The pollen grain is surrounded by an elaborate cell wall. In some species, the generative cell immediately divides again to give a pair of sperm cells. In most flowering plants, however this division takes place later, in the tube that develops when a pollen grain germinates.

We collected expression data for 15 conditions: aerobic growth in Luria-Bertani broth; aerobic growth in defined minimal media with 8 different carbon sources (20 mM D,L-lactate, 20 mM pyruvate, 10 mM acetate, 20 mM N-acetylglucosamine (NAG), 5 mg/mL mixed amino acids (CAS), 1 mg/mL gelatin, 0.5% Tween-20, or 7.5 mM inosine); aerobic growth in defined lactate medium with four different stresses (70 micromolar copper(II) chloride; 1 mM sodium nitrite; 1.5 micromolar nalidixic acid, an inhibitor of DNA gyrase; or acid stress at pH 6); and anaerobic growth in a defined medium with 20 mM D,L-lactate or 20 mM NAG as the carbon source and 30 mM fumarate as the electron acceptor. Our defined medium contained 30 mM PIPES buffer, salts (1.5 g/L NH4Cl, 0.1 g/L KCl, 1.75 g/L NaCl, 0.61 g/L MgCl2.6H20, 0.6 g/L NaH2PO4), Wolfe's vitamins, and Wolfe's minerals, at pH 7. For the stress experiments, the carbon source was 20 mM D,L-lactate. For growth at pH 6, we used 30 mM MES buffer instead of PIPES. All samples were grown at 30C with shaking at 200 rpm. For three conditions, we also measured gene expression during batch growth. We collected cells at varying times after inoculation of batch aerobic growth at OD600 of 0.1 on minimal lactate medium, minimal NAG medium, or LB.

OBSOLETE. Catalysis of the formation of ice crystals in extracellular fluid at relatively high temperatures (up to -2 degrees C) to protect the organism from damage by intracellular ice formation. Ice nucleation proteins function by binding an ice crystal and then encouraging it to form larger crystals. Ice nucleation is a chemical process but these proteins can positively regulate it. There are two different uses of ice nucleation proteins: bacteria secrete them extracellularly to cause a host organism's cells to freeze and die, and fish use them to protect themselves from intracellular ice formation.

OBSOLETE. Catalysis of the formation of ice crystals in extracellular fluid at relatively high temperatures (up to -2 degrees C) to protect the organism from damage by intracellular ice formation. Ice nucleation proteins function by binding an ice crystal and then encouraging it to form larger crystals. Ice nucleation is a chemical process but these proteins can positively regulate it. There are two different uses of ice nucleation proteins: bacteria secrete them extracellularly to cause a host organism's cells to freeze and die, and fish use them to protect themselves from intracellular ice formation.
