To remove oxygen, the media were boiled for 10 minutes and flushed with a mixture of 80% N2/20% CO2 for 30 min. After that, the pH was adjusted to 7.2. The optical density during anaerobic growth on ferric citrate was measured at a wavelength of 655 nm to avoid an influence by ferric iron.

Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, Geobacter sulfurreducens PCA and Geobacter metallireducens GS-15 were routinely cultured anaerobically at 30 ᵒC on a medium that was developed following Coppi et al. (2001) and Holmes et al. (2004). The growth medium contained 0.42 g/l KH2PO4, 0.22 g/l K2HPO4, 0.2 g/l NH4Cl, 0.38 g/l KCl, 0.36 g/l NaCl, 0.21 g/l MgCl2 6H2O, 1.8 g/l NaHCO3, 0.5 g/l Na2CO3, 60 mg/l CaCl2 2H2O, 2 g/l casitone and was further complemented with 1.0 ml/l of selenite-tungstate solution (0.5 g/l NaOH, 3 mg/l Na2SeO3, 4 mg/l Na2WO4 2H2O), 10 ml NB/l trace mineral solution (Coppi et al. 2001), 10 ml/l vitamin solution (German Type Culture Collection, DSMZ, media 141), 0.2 mM sodium ascorbate, 1.0 mM cysteine, 0.2 % (w/v) yeast extract and 50 mM ferric citrate as an electron acceptor. The medium contained sodium lactate (12.5 mM), sodium acetate (6.25 mM) sodium propionate (5 mM) as electron donors. Standard anaerobic techniques were used throughout the study (Balch et al. (1976)). All anaerobic media were prepared in bottles capped with butyl rubber stoppers. To remove oxygen, the media were boiled for 10 minutes and flushed with a mixture of 80% N2/20% CO2 for 30 min. After that, the pH was adjusted to 7.2. The optical density during anaerobic growth on ferric citrate was measured at a wavelength of 655 nm to avoid an influence by ferric iron.  All experiments were carried out in at least three independent replicates. Error bars represent the standard deviation.

The bioreactor was then switched to continuous mode with a dilution rate of 0.05 h−1 while DOT was still maintained at 20%. After 48 hours in continuous mode, a reference sample of cells was harvested for RNA isolation (control).

","Based on the experiment description provided, the summarized conditions are as follows:

- Strain: Wild type strain
- Growth medium: Nutritionally rich LB medium
- Growth time: 3 hours
- Culture samples were taken at different time intervals, centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C, treated with RNA protect solution (Qiagen), and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for total RNA extraction
- Cells were grown at 30°C with close to 20% dissolved O2 in a Bioflo110 bioreactor (New Brunswick Scientific, Edison, NJ) containing 1.2 L of growth medium at pH 7.2
- Lactate minimal medium was supplemented with 50 mM D,L-lactate

To map these conditions to Gene Ontology (GO) terms, we can identify the following relevant relationships:

1. Strain: 'wild-type strain' would correspond to the concept 'wild-type strain' in GO (GO:0065007).
2. Growth medium: 'nutritionally rich LB medium' could be associated with the term 'nutritionally rich medium' (GO:0034350) in GO.
3. Growth time: '3 hours' would not directly map to a specific GO term, but could be related to the concept of 'temporal duration' in GO.
4. Culture sampling process: The process of 'centrifugation' (GO:0005796), 'treatment with RNA protect solution' (undefined in GO), and 'flash freezing in liquid nitrogen' (undefined in GO) can be linked to the corresponding biological processes.
5. Oxygen levels and temperature control: The conditions of '30°C temperature' and '20% dissolved O2' may relate to the concepts of 'temperature homeostasis' (GO:0042333) and 'oxygen homeostasis' (GO:0015671) in GO, respectively.
6. Growth medium supplementation: The addition of '50 mM D,L-lactate' could be associated with the concept of 'organic acid metabolic process' (GO:0006082) or 'carboxylic acid metabolic process' (GO:0019752) in GO.

Translating the experiment conditions to concepts in the Gene Ontology (GO) can be challenging as GO primarily focuses on defining gene and gene product attributes. However, we can identify some relevant GO terms that could potentially be associated with the experiment conditions provided:

1. Wild type strain: ""wild-type strain"" in the context of gene ontology can be associated with the term ""wild-type phenotype"" (GO:0000118).

2. Growth medium: The description mentions the use of a nutritionally rich LB medium. While there may not be a direct one-to-one match, the general term related to growth medium in GO could be ""nutrient reservoir activity"" (GO:0045735).

3. Growth time: The duration of 7 hours for growth time does not have a specific GO term associated with it, as GO primarily focuses on molecular and cellular biology concepts.

4. RNA extraction: This step involves the extraction of total RNA from the samples, which could be linked to terms such as ""RNA binding"" (GO:0003723) or ""RNA processing"" (GO:0006396).

5. Bioreactor conditions: The parameters mentioned, such as temperature (30°C), dissolved O2 levels, and growth medium details, do not have direct equivalents in GO, as GO primarily focuses on gene-related concepts.

strain: MR-1
Bacterial pellets were collected by centrifuging cultures for 10 minutes at 10,000 g at 4 C in RNAse free 50ml polypropylene tubes.  Supernatant was immediately poured off and pellets were stored at -80 C. After thawing, RNA was extracted with RNeasy miniprep columns (Qiagen) with the optional on-column DNase treatment.  RNA quality was confirmed with an Agilent Bioanalyze.  Ribosomal RNA was depleted with the MICROBExpress kit (Ambion), which uses magnetic beads that bind to oligonucleotides that hybridize to ribosomal RNA.
