MR-1(pBBR-glk-galP) was grown in GMM supplemented with fumarate (40 mM) as an electron acceptor, and cells were harvested at the logarithmic growth phase (OD600 0.2–0.3). These cells were incubated for 3 h in the presence (the fumarate-respiring condition) or absence (the fermentative condition) of fumarate.
","The chemical reactions and pathways involving fumarate, the anion of trans-1,2-ethenedicarboxylic acid, the diastereoisomer of maleate. It is a key intermediate in metabolism and is formed in the TCA cycle from succinate and converted into malate.
fumarate metabolism
fumarate metabolic process","The chemical reactions and pathways resulting in the breakdown of 2,5-dihydroxypyridine to form fumarate. 2,5-dihydroxypyridine is dioxygenated to give maleamate and formate; the maleamate from this reaction is then converted to maleate, which is then isomerized to fumurate.

L-aspartate:fumarate antiporter activity","fumarylpyruvate hydrolase activity
Catalysis of the reaction: fumarylpyruvate + H2O = fumarate + pyruvate + H+.","glycolytic fermentation via PFL pathway
The glycolytic fermentation beginning with the anaerobic conversion of glucose to pyruvate by the glycolytic pathway, followed by pyruvate:formate lyase (PFL) activity. This pathway is found in facultative anaerobes such as E. coli.","A membrane-bound flavoenzyme complex consisting of four subunits, A, B, C, and D. A and B comprise the membrane-extrinsic catalytic domain and C (InterPro:IPR003510; InterPro:IPR004224) and D (InterPro:IPR003418) link the catalytic centers to the electron-transport chain. This family consists of the 13 kDa hydrophobic subunit D. This component may be required to anchor the catalytic components of the fumarate reductase complex to the cytoplasmic membrane. Fumarate reductase couples the reduction of fumarate to succinate to the oxidation of quinol to quinone, in a reaction opposite to that catalyzed by the related complex II of the respiratory chain (succinate dehydrogenase-(ubiquinone)).

The medium contained sodium lactate (12.5 mM), sodium acetate (6.25 mM) sodium propionate (5 mM) as electron donors. Standard anaerobic techniques were used throughout the study (Balch et al.

To remove oxygen, the media were boiled for 10 minutes and flushed with a mixture of 80% N2/20% CO2 for 30 min. After that, the pH was adjusted to 7.2. The optical density during anaerobic growth on ferric citrate was measured at a wavelength of 655 nm to avoid an influence by ferric iron.  All experiments were carried out in at least three independent replicates. Error bars represent the standard deviation.

RNA capping
m(7)G RNA capping
The sequence of enzymatic reactions by which the RNA 5' cap structure, an inverted 7-methylguanosine linked via a 5'-5' triphosphate bridge (m7G(5')ppp(5')X) to the first transcribed residue, is added to a nascent transcript. Additional methylation can occur on the ribose sugars of the first and second nucleotides adjacent to the m7G nRNA cap. These methylations are often referred to as N6,2'-O-dimethyladenosine (m6,2A) and N6,2'-O-dimethylguanosine (m6,2G), respectively."

The growth medium contained 0.42 g/l KH2PO4, 0.22 g/l K2HPO4, 0.2 g/l NH4Cl, 0.38 g/l KCl, 0.36 g/l NaCl, 0.21 g/l MgCl2 6H2O, 1.8 g/l NaHCO3, 0.5 g/l Na2CO3, 60 mg/l CaCl2 2H2O, 2 g/l casitone and was further complemented with 1.0 ml/l of selenite-tungstate solution (0.5 g/l NaOH, 3 mg/l Na2SeO3, 4 mg/l Na2WO4 2H2O), 10 ml NB/l trace mineral solution (Coppi et al. 2001), 10 ml/l vitamin solution (German Type Culture Collection, DSMZ, media 141), 0.2 mM sodium ascorbate, 1.0 mM cysteine, 0.2 % (w/v) yeast extract and 50 mM ferric citrate as an electron acceptor. The medium contained sodium lactate (12.5 mM), sodium acetate (6.25 mM) sodium propionate (5 mM) as electron donors. Standard anaerobic techniques were used throughout the study (Balch et al. (1976)). All anaerobic media were prepared in bottles capped with butyl rubber stoppers. To remove oxygen, the media were boiled for 10 minutes and flushed with a mixture of 80% N2/20% CO2 for 30 min. After that, the pH was adjusted to 7.2. The optical density during anaerobic growth on ferric citrate was measured at a wavelength of 655 nm to avoid an influence by ferric iron.  All experiments were carried out in at least three independent replicates. Error bars represent the standard deviation.

To remove oxygen, the media were boiled for 10 minutes and flushed with a mixture of 80% N2/20% CO2 for 30 min. After that, the pH was adjusted to 7.2. The optical density during anaerobic growth on ferric citrate was measured at a wavelength of 655 nm to avoid an influence by ferric iron.

A 20% dissolved oxygen tension (DOT) was maintained until the culture reached stationary phase. The bioreactor was then switched to continuous mode with a dilution rate of 0.05 h−1 while DOT was still maintained at 20%. After 48 hours in continuous mode, a reference sample of cells was harvested for RNA isolation (control). The automatic DOT control was then turned off and DOT was reduced from 20% to 0% (within 3-5 minutes). Once the DOT was no longer measurable by a polarographic O2 electrode, the first sample was taken (t=0). However, note that this was not an anaerobic state; air was still being provided to the reactor, but with DOT just below detection of the polarographic O2 electrode. Samples were subsequently taken at 15 min intervals for an hour.
Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 were grown in continuous flow reactors. Throughout the experiment, agitation was maintained at 200 rpm and culture maintained at pH 7.0 at 30 °C.

A 20% dissolved oxygen tension (DOT) was maintained until the culture reached stationary phase. The bioreactor was then switched to continuous mode with a dilution rate of 0.05 h−1 while DOT was still maintained at 20%. After 48 hours in continuous mode, a reference sample of cells was harvested for RNA isolation (control). The automatic DOT control was then turned off and DOT was reduced from 20% to 0% (within 3-5 minutes). Once the DOT was no longer measurable by a polarographic O2 electrode, the first sample was taken (t=0). However, note that this was not an anaerobic state; air was still being provided to the reactor, but with DOT just below detection of the polarographic O2 electrode. Samples were subsequently taken at 15 min intervals for an hour.
Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 were grown in continuous flow reactors. Throughout the experiment, agitation was maintained at 200 rpm and culture maintained at pH 7.0 at 30 °C.

The gas flow rate and agitation were kept at 3.5 L min 1 and 350 rpm, respectively, and the dissolved oxygen tension (DOT) was maintained at 20% or 8.5% by automatically changing the ratio of N2 and air in the gas mix. The  pH was maintained at 7.0.Culture growth was constantly monitored by measuring and recording optical density. Continuous cultures were started by pumping medium of the same composition at desired dilution rate. Samples for further analysis were taken after at least five volume changes at steady-state conditions.

snoRNA metabolism
The chemical reactions and pathways involving snoRNA, small nucleolar RNA, any of a class of small RNAs that are associated with the eukaryotic nucleus as components of small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins.

","cell wall of Gram-positive Bacteria
20-80nm peptidoglycan-based cell wall
A layer of peptidoglycan found outside of the cytoplasmic membrane. The peptidoglycan is relatively thick (20-80nm) and retains the primary stain of the Gram procedure, thus cells appear blue after Gram stain. The cell walls often contain teichoic acids (acidic anionic polysaccharides) bound to the peptidoglycan. Examples of this component are found in Gram-positive bacteria.
Gram-positive-bacterium-type cell wall","1-2nm peptidoglycan-based cell wall
Gram-negative-bacterium-type cell wall
The peptidoglycan layer of the Gram-negative cell envelope. In Gram-negative cells the peptidoglycan is relatively thin (1-2nm) and is linked to the outer membrane by lipoproteins. In Gram-negative cells the peptidoglycan is too thin to retain the primary stain in the Gram staining procedure and therefore cells appear red after Gram stain.

bacterial-type flagellum motor force generator complex
A hetero-hexameric complex of 2 membrane proteins, A and B, with stoichiometry A4B2. The A and B proteins form a channel through which flow the ions that power the bacterial-type flagellum. They form the stator, or nonrotating portion, of the flagellum motor with the B protein apparently attached to the peptidoglycan cell wall. Examples include the H+ driven MotA-MotB stator complex of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica, and the Na+ driven PomA-PomB stator complex of Vibrio and Shewanella species.","conidium germination
The physiological and developmental changes that occur in a conidium or asexual spore following release from dormancy up to the earliest signs of development such as swelling of conidia, adhesion and nuclear decondensation followed by hyphal growth several hours later. In many genera of plant pathogenic fungi (e.g. Magnaporthe, Colletotrichum, Ustilago), swelling of the hyphal tips to form appressorium, metabolic activities including respiration, RNA and protein synthesis and trehalose breakdown and changes in cell wall composition can be detected in conidium germination.","flagellum pocket collar

Catalysis of the formation of ice crystals in extracellular fluid at relatively high temperatures (up to -2 degrees C) to protect the organism from damage by intracellular ice formation. Ice nucleation proteins function by binding an ice crystal and then encouraging it to form larger crystals. Ice nucleation is a chemical process but these proteins can positively regulate it. There are two different uses of ice nucleation proteins: bacteria secrete them extracellularly to cause a host organism's cells to freeze and die, and fish use them to protect themselves from intracellular ice formation.
