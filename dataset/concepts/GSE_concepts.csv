The gas flow rate and agitation were kept at 3.5 L min 1 and 350 rpm, respectively, and the dissolved oxygen tension (DOT) was maintained at 20% or 8.5% by automatically changing the ratio of N2 and air in the gas mix. The  pH was maintained at 7.0.Culture growth was constantly monitored by measuring and recording optical density. Continuous cultures were started by pumping medium of the same composition at desired dilution rate. Samples for further analysis were taken after at least five volume changes at steady-state conditions.

The medium contained sodium lactate (12.5 mM), sodium acetate (6.25 mM) sodium propionate (5 mM) as electron donors. Standard anaerobic techniques were used throughout the study (Balch et al.

To remove oxygen, the media were boiled for 10 minutes and flushed with a mixture of 80% N2/20% CO2 for 30 min. After that, the pH was adjusted to 7.2. The optical density during anaerobic growth on ferric citrate was measured at a wavelength of 655 nm to avoid an influence by ferric iron.

A 20% dissolved oxygen tension (DOT) was maintained until the culture reached stationary phase. The bioreactor was then switched to continuous mode with a dilution rate of 0.05 h−1 while DOT was still maintained at 20%. After 48 hours in continuous mode, a reference sample of cells was harvested for RNA isolation (control). The automatic DOT control was then turned off and DOT was reduced from 20% to 0% (within 3-5 minutes). Once the DOT was no longer measurable by a polarographic O2 electrode, the first sample was taken (t=0). However, note that this was not an anaerobic state; air was still being provided to the reactor, but with DOT just below detection of the polarographic O2 electrode.

After 48 hours in continuous mode, a reference sample of cells was harvested for RNA isolation (control). The automatic DOT control was then turned off and DOT was reduced from 20% to 0% (within 3-5 minutes). Once the DOT was no longer measurable by a polarographic O2 electrode, the first sample was taken (t=0). However, note that this was not an anaerobic state; air was still being provided to the reactor, but with DOT just below detection of the polarographic O2 electrode. Samples were subsequently taken at 15 min intervals for an hour.
Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 were grown in continuous flow reactors. Throughout the experiment, agitation was maintained at 200 rpm and culture maintained at pH 7.0 at 30 °C.

genotype: WT
growth protocol: grown under a non-flow condition
Cells associated with the WE were suspended in LMM with vigorous pipetting. After vortex-mixing, the cell suspension was centrifuged at 15,000 g for 5 min to precipitate the cells.
An electrochemical flow cell (EFC) was filled with lactate minimal medium (LMM) containing gentamicin (Gm) and was purged with pure nitrogen gas (99.999%) for anaerobic operation. After inoculation with AFP-expressing MR-1 pregrown in LB medium supplemented with Gm, the electrodes were connected to a potentiostat (VMP3; Bio-Logic Science Instruments, Seyssinet-Pariset, France), and the potential of the working electrode (WE) was poised at +0.2 V (versus the standard hydrogen electrode). After inoculation, medium (electrolyte) was not supplied to the EFC for approximately 1 h, to allow MR-1 cells to attach to the WE. For operation under the electrolyte-flow conditions, LMM containing Gm was supplied to the EFC at a constant linear velocity of 5.5 mm min-1. The EFC was operated for 48 h (for the flow condition) or 78 h (for the non-flow condition) until the WE-associated cells reached the early stationary growth phase.

Cells associated with the WE were suspended in LMM with vigorous pipetting. After vortex-mixing, the cell suspension was centrifuged at 15,000 g for 5 min to precipitate the cells.
An electrochemical flow cell (EFC) was filled with lactate minimal medium (LMM) containing gentamicin (Gm) and was purged with pure nitrogen gas (99.999%) for anaerobic operation. After inoculation with AFP-expressing MR-1 pregrown in LB medium supplemented with Gm, the electrodes were connected to a potentiostat (VMP3; Bio-Logic Science Instruments, Seyssinet-Pariset, France), and the potential of the working electrode (WE) was poised at +0.2 V (versus the standard hydrogen electrode). After inoculation, medium (electrolyte) was not supplied to the EFC for approximately 1 h, to allow MR-1 cells to attach to the WE. For operation under the electrolyte-flow conditions, LMM containing Gm was supplied to the EFC at a constant linear velocity of 5.5 mm min-1. The EFC was operated for 48 h (for the flow condition) or 78 h (for the non-flow condition) until the WE-associated cells reached the early stationary growth phase.

After inoculation with AFP-expressing MR-1 or SO_3096 pregrown in LB medium supplemented with Gm, the electrodes were connected to a potentiostat (VMP3; Bio-Logic Science Instruments, Seyssinet-Pariset, France), and the potential of the working electrode (WE) was poised at +0.2 V (versus the standard hydrogen electrode). After inoculation, medium (electrolyte) was not supplied to the EFC for approximately 1 h, to allow S. oneidensis cells to attach to the WE. After inoculation, LMM containing Gm was supplied to the EFC at a constant linear velocity of 5.5 mm min-1. The EFC was operated for 48 h until the WE-associated cells reached the early stationary growth phase.
","Experimental conditions can be summarised as follows:
- Strain: AFP-expressing MR-1
- Genotype: Wild type (WT)
- Growth protocol: Cells were grown under an electrolyte-flow condition
- Method of cell suspension: Cells associated with the working electrode (WE) were suspended in low-mineral medium (LMM) with vigorous pipetting, followed by centrifugation to precipitate the cells
- Electrochemical flow cell (EFC) setup: EFC filled with lactate minimal medium (LMM) containing gentamicin (Gm), purged with pure nitrogen gas for anaerobic operation
- Inoculation: AFP-expressing MR-1 cells pre-grown in LB medium supplemented with Gm were inoculated into the EFC
- Electrode connection: The electrodes were connected to a potentiostat, and the potential of the working electrode (WE) was poised at +0.2 V versus the standard hydrogen electrode

After inoculation, medium (electrolyte) was not supplied to the EFC for approximately 1 h, to allow S. oneidensis cells to attach to the WE. After inoculation, LMM containing Gm was supplied to the EFC at a constant linear velocity of 5.5 mm min-1.
